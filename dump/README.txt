  SimpleGeo International Neighborhoods Dump
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This archive contains the SimpleGeo International Neighborhoods dataset from 04
August 2011 in various formats.

-------------
What's Inside
-------------

    geojson/    GeoJSON, one per city
    kml/        KML, one per city
    shp/        A single ESRI Shapefile of the entire dataset

Each record in the Shapefile also includes the name of the city, the WoE ID of
the city (parent_id), and the WoE feature type (either "Suburb" in the case of
informal neighborhoods, or "LocalAdmin" in the case of formal city divisions).

Otherwise, the three formats provided in this archive are functionally
identical.
